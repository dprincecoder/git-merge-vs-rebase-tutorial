    <p>First merge</p>
    <h3>Second beginning on dev</h3>
    <p>dev fixes while one commit is on main</p>

    <h2>
      Using pull from main fixed it. Which means we merged main into dev, but we
      are supposed to merge dev into main.
    </h2>

    <h5>Changes on main</h5>

    <h1>New dev</h1>
